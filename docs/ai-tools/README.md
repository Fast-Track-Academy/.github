- Encourage deeper exploration of topics through guided inquiry
- Practice defending positions with evidence and reasoning

#### **Example Dialogue Framework**
```
Student: "What causes climate change?"
AI Tutor: "That's a great question! Before I explain, what do you already know about the atmosphere and greenhouse gases? What have you observed about weather patterns?"
```
